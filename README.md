# binary-tree-study

Repository to register my study about binary trees.


## Binary Search Tree
`binary_search_tree.py` contains the implementation of a binary search tree, some functions to help with the implementation and functions use to check the structures.

## Height
`tree_height.py` contains multiple functions to calculate the height of a binary tree and the thought process to get there.

## Level Order Traversal
`level_order_traversal.py` contains a function to print the level order traversal of a binary tree. The order traversal is defined by visiting the nodes level by level from left to right.
